use django , tailwind ,alpine js ,sqllite in local ,pgsql in production

create a "RamJaap" web app , user can type ram naam , select timer 5m ,10 m , 15 min ,30 min ,60 min ,also can select number to type as ram jaap like 10000 times , 100000 times give option in user 
can view top devotee ,create very good looking landing page

user can login check all japp user did in past,
on home page show ladder board


after loin open  a text form  that take input and count , count =1 when some one type "ram" or "Ram"

then when submit it store in his account , 


so any one ligin and start writeing Ram Ram Ram 


in his dashbaord show total number of Ram Count 
also on home page public show number of user & 

total numbers of Total ram Written by users


ask question if concept is not clear
give option to write ram  naam ( user can type ram ram in a form )
auto convert any input buy user in "Ram" , input can be ram,rAm,RAM,rAM,RaM AND MANY INPUTS (CHECK)

also take input in hindi too.


correction 
i want to by default opend form for ram nam input , move counter of ram nam on 2nd page "count" , current page only show user input form fetures ,also i want text transfom featers and i want i use typr ram  auto space apllied not need to press space button 


update :
time option & Jaap Target will be as  button , move on top of input form , Ram Naam couter move to above input form (make big bold - in center ) , time oprion ,jaap target & couter will be in line just abobe input form .


all user userinterface ll be very easy as so non technical also use this app easyly 

most be mobile respinshive ,
users be able to pause and resume their Jaap sessions , when user submit 
its store in traget and in next session user can continue and so on .

2nd phase :
there be social sharing features for users to share their achievements.
there be different user levels/badges based on Jaap counts.
we need to implement notifications when users reach their targets
