## Automated Testing

For automated testing of responsive design, consider implementing:

- Jest with Puppeteer for automated viewport testing
- Cypress for visual regression testing
- Lighthouse CI for performance and accessibility testing

## Fixing Issues

When fixing responsive design issues:

1. Use mobile-first approach
2. Implement CSS using relative units (rem, em, %)
3. Use appropriate media queries
4. Test changes across all target devices
5. Avoid fixed width/height where possible
