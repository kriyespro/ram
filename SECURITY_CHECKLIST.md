- [x] Secret key stored as environment variable
- [x] Allowed hosts properly configured
- [x] Use HTTPS in production
- [x] Secure cookies enabled
- [x] CSRF protection enabled
- [x] HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) enabled
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff enabled
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY enabled
- [x] XSS protection enabled
- [x] SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
- [x] SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'

### 2. Database Security

- [x] Database credentials stored as environment variables
- [x] Regular database backups configured
- [x] Sensitive data encrypted where necessary
- [x] Limited database user permissions

### 3. Authentication Security

- [x] Password validation rules enforced
- [x] Password hashing using PBKDF2 (Django default)
- [x] Rate limiting for login attempts
- [x] Session expiry configured
- [x] Secure password reset mechanism

## Security Testing Procedures

### 1. Input Validation Testing

- [ ] Test for SQL injection
- [ ] Test for XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for CSRF vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for command injection
- [ ] Validate form inputs
- [ ] Test file upload security

### 2. Authentication Testing

- [ ] Test password strength requirements
- [ ] Test account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Test session management
- [ ] Test password reset functionality
- [ ] Test account recovery processes

### 3. Authorization Testing

- [ ] Test access controls
- [ ] Test privileged function access
- [ ] Test against horizontal privilege escalation
- [ ] Test against vertical privilege escalation
- [ ] Test for insecure direct object references

### 4. Data Protection Testing

- [ ] Test for sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Test secure transmission of sensitive data
- [ ] Test secure storage of sensitive data
- [ ] Test database backup security

## Security Tools and Resources

### 1. Tools for Security Testing

- [Django Security Middleware](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/topics/security/)
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (Python static code analysis)
- [Safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) (checks dependencies for vulnerabilities)
- [Django-security](https://github.com/sdelements/django-security)

### 2. Security Scanning Commands

```bash
# Check Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Scan code for security issues
pip install bandit
bandit -r .

# Run Django security checks
python manage.py check --deploy
```

## Security Incident Response

1. **Identification**: Monitor logs and systems for unusual activity
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and fix vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems and data
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident and improve defenses

## Regular Security Maintenance

- [ ] Keep Django and all dependencies updated
- [ ] Regularly review security settings
- [ ] Perform periodic security assessments
- [ ] Monitor security mailing lists
- [ ] Use a dependency vulnerability scanner
- [ ] Conduct code reviews with a security focus

## External Services Security

- [ ] Verify API security
- [ ] Monitor third-party service security
- [ ] Use API keys securely
- [ ] Store credentials in environment variables
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for external services

## Additional Security Considerations

- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Use secure development practices
- [ ] Conduct regular security training
- [ ] Maintain a responsible disclosure policy
- [ ] Consider penetration testing for critical features
